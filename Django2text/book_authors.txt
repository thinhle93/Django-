from apps.book_authors.models import *

/to connect book and author, must make the book and author first
Book.objects.create(name="Pirates", desc="A book about pirates")
Author.objects.create(fname="Thinh", lname="Le", email="thinh@gmail.com")
/then do these 3 lines
thisbook = Book.objects.get(id=1) /since the first book has id of 1
thisauthor = Author.objects.get(id=1) /first author made also has id 1
thisauthor.books.add(thisbook) / books is the name under author

/ when you many books under one author
a = thisauthor.books.all()
a[0].name /or whatever you want to call on the book youre looking at 

/to do the reverse where you look up the authors of one book, you use the related name instead of "books"
f = Book.objects.get(id=1)
g = f.authors.all() /authors is the related name / or just call f.all() which will give the same as calling g
f[0].fname /or whatever 

/to remove a book from an author 
set variable to the book
set variable to the author 
(variable for book).remove(variable for book)

To look at everything other than the one you want use exclude
Author.objects.exclude(name="Thinh") /this will give you the list of authors except for Thinh
